# THA2 
For this project I am using Migrant stock data from the UN portal to see how migrant number and flow has changed through the years.
The idea is to see whether migration out of Nepal has increased or decreased fromm 2000 to 2008, during the height of the Maoist Insurgency
It was also interesting to see migration that was happening to Nepal during that time period and if so did migration decrease due to Maoist insurgency
By looking at numbers provided by the UN data stock and during contexual research around Nepal's political situation for the time period, I will be able to draw connection about whether the not Maoist insrugency increased or decresed migration
It would also be interesting to see as whether migration decreased into Nepal due to the insurgency
